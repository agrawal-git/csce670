## Search 'em all

Code repo for the CSCE 670 (Information retrieval) final project.

### Running:

To run the flask app:

- Install flask via "pip install flask"
- Run "python index.py" in the terminal.
- Go to "localhost:5000" or "127.0.0.1:5000" in your browser.
- Profit!


### Adding code
To add code, make sure you create a new file, add functionality in it, and import it in the index.py file. Keep your code modular and object oriented please! 

For instance, to add search functionality, you might want to add a search.py file, which contains a Search class that contains all the functionality of search. To perform a search, you do an "import Search from search" and access all the methods you want to access.
